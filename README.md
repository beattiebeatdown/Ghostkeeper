# Ghostkeeper
is a python script that takes a list of firewalls from a .csv and backs up the running config 
csv fields are customer/hostname/ip/username/password/enablepassword

There are also env variables that need set. Will add more detail on this later.

Will also add more information into the README when I get some more time.
